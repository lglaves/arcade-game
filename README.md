## UDACITY FEND - Project P3: Classic Arcade Game Clone

Using the base project provided by Udacity, I added new functionality to create a 2d javascript/html game similar to the classic arcade game "Frogger".  

This project resides at: https://github.com/lglaves/arcade-game

* Colliding with a bug causes you to lose 50 points, and be returned to start row.
* Reaching the water gives you an extra 50 points, and returns your character to start row.

### To win Level 2:  800 points wins.  You have 3 minutes to complete Level 2.
