===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

# UDACITY Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree 
# Project P3: Classic Arcade Game Clone

Udacity provided the game loop engine and 2d assets.  Using this base project, I added new functionality to creat a 2d game similar to the classic arcade game "Frogger".  

#Game Rules

------------------------
Move the player by pressing the arrows Up, Down, Left or Right.
Pause the game by pressing F1.
Avoid the bugs and try to reach the water.
Collect the gems, hearts, keys and stars for extra points. 
Implement: If you get a star, you can kill the bugs and reduce their number.
